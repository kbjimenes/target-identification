# Resources
**Files:**

* '253TCM.csv'.- List of targets and their codes used for modeling TCM.
    + ﻿TARGET_ID.- Target ID
    + UNIPROT_ID.- Uniprot ID
 
**Directories:**

* '/data'.- Clean data for the CHEMBL releases 27, 28 and 31.
* '/TCM/SCALE'.- Models for scaling compound data for the physichochemical properties (DSC) and the fusion of morgan figer print and DSC descriptors (FUS)
* '/TCM/DS'.- Application domain based on distance for the TCM models. Inside there is the centroid(vector) and the limit used for training and validate each model.
* '/TCM/MODELS'.- TCM models trained with morgan’s  fingerprint (FGP), molecular properties (DSC) and the fusion of both (FUS) descriptors; and the algorithms of decision tree (DT), gaussian naive bayes (GM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).
